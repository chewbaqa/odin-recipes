        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            I made this Flamin' Hot Cheetos fried chicken one day, when I
            thought, I use Flamin’ Hot Cheetos to bread fried pickles and onion
            rings, so why not fried chicken? They lose a lot of heat during the
            process, so don't skip the cayenne pepper.
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                6 cups cheese puffs, such as CHEETOS® Crunchy FLAMIN’ HOT®
                Cheese Flavored Snacks
            </li>
            <li>1 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 pound chicken breast tenderloins (about 8 pieces)</li>
            <li>1/4 cup mayonnaise</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Place Cheetos in a blender and pulse until fine crumbs. Pour
                crumbs into a 1-gallon resealable plastic bag. Add cayenne and
                salt. Seal the bag and shake to combine.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place chicken tenders in a 1-quart resealable plastic bag. Add
                mayonnaise. Seal the bag and massage chicken in mayonnaise until
                evenly coated.
            </li>
            <li>
                Transfer 2 chicken tenders from their bag to the bag with Cheeto
                crumbs. Seal the bag and shake until evenly coated. Place
                tenders on a plate. Repeat with remaining tenders.
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat oil in a skillet over medium high heat. Add breaded chicken
                tenders in a single layer and cook for 6 minutes. Using a
                spatula, flip tenders over and cook until tenders are no longer
                pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 6 minutes
                more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center
                should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
            </li>

                Enjoy!
