            Wondering how to cook sausage? Fresh sausage is easy to cook - you
            can grill them, bake them in the oven, or cook them in a skillet on
            the stove top. Here we describe the grill method in detail so your
            sausages will turn out perfectly.
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                1 pound fresh sausage links (such as bratwurst, Italian sausage,
                or kielbasa)
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat a gas grill to medium-high (400 degrees F to 450 degrees
                F (200 degrees C to 230 degrees C)) on 1 side, or push hot coals
                to 1 side of a charcoal grill. Place sausage links on the oiled
                grates over the unlit side of grill.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cover and grill until a thermometer inserted into thickest
                portion of sausage registers 150 degrees F (66 degrees C), 8 to
                10 minutes, turning halfway through cook time.
            </li>
            <li>
                Move sausage to the lit side of grill; grill, uncovered, turning
                once halfway through, until browned and a thermometer inserted
                into thickest portion of sausage registers 160 degrees F (71
                degrees C), 1 to 2 minutes. Serve as desired.
